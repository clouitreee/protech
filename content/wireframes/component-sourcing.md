# Component Sourcing Recommendations

This document provides recommendations for sourcing or implementing each modular UI component, primarily focusing on popular React UI libraries and frameworks.

## Recommended Libraries/Frameworks

- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
- **Headless UI**: For unstyled, accessible UI components (e.g., Accordion, Carousel, Dialog) that integrate well with Tailwind CSS.
- **Chakra UI**: A comprehensive component library offering accessible, composable React components with a focus on developer experience.
- **React Hook Form / Zod**: For robust form management and validation.
- **Leaflet.js / Google Maps API**: For interactive map functionalities.
