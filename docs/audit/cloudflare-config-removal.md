# Cloudflare Configuration Removal Report

This document logs the removal of Cloudflare-specific configuration files from the repository, as these settings are to be managed exclusively within the Cloudflare Dashboard.

## Removed Files and Directories

| File/Directory | Reason for Removal | Managed in Cloudflare Dashboard |
| :------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | Contains Cloudflare Pages and D1 configuration. | Pages project settings, D1 database bindings, Environment Variables. |
| `migrations/`    | Contains D1 database migration files. | D1 database migrations (via Wrangler CLI or Dashboard). |

## Justification

Centralizing Cloudflare-specific configurations within the Cloudflare Dashboard enhances security, simplifies deployment workflows, and prevents sensitive information (like `database_id`s or environment-specific variables) from being inadvertently committed to the repository. This approach aligns with best practices for managing infrastructure-as-code in a serverless environment.
